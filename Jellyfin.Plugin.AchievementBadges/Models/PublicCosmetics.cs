/// into markup, and gated by the same privacy toggles as the equipped badge
/// preview: a user who hid their showcase shows no bling either.
/// <para>
/// The profile theme is not here on purpose. The shareable card skins are
/// drawn in the rank tier's colour, and painting them in the user's theme
/// is a redesign of the three templates rather than a projection of data.
